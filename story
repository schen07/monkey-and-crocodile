**story**
once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resides on a berry tree, 
which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile, and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river, and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits, and the crocodile came back the next day for more fruits,
as he loved them.
As the day passed by, the crocodile and monkey became good friends.
